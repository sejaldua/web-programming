Joe’s only sells three items: hotdogs ($3.25 each), French Fries ($2.00 each) and Drinks ($1.50 each).  Because of the low prices, Joe is swamped and is hoping online orders will help to manage the flow of customers better so that he can gain more revenue at peak hours. This assignment includes a form, some Javascript conditional checks to apply a discount and/or tax to the order, and then a receipt is displayed as an event handler for a button press.

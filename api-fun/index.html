        <h2>About TheMealDB API</h2>
        <p>TheMealDB is an open online database of recipes for meals. It was written by somebody who felt that there was no suitable API for his needs, so he wrote one himself. It is very rudimentary, but it provides the names of meals that someone might want to cook, high quality PNG images of ingredients, and also high quality PNG images of fully-cooked meals. Some things you can do with it are:
        <ul>
            <li>Search a meal by name</li>
            <li>Lookup full meal details by id</li>
            <li>Looup a random meal</li>
            <li>Get latest meals (to keep things spicy!)</li>
            <li>List all categories, area, and ingredients</li>
            <li>Filter by ingredient</li>
            <li>Filter by category</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Options for the API Request</h2>
        <p>Data can be retrieved from the API using many options: meal name (s=), first letter (f=), id (i=), categories (c=), area / cuisine (a=), or ingredients (i=). For my GET request, I used the filter by main ingredient feature, which uses the filter.php page with the ?i=word query string. The input field allows the user to specify which ingredient to use as the API query string for the request. As a default, I set this variable equal to "chicken". You see these results when the page is loaded initially. When a user enters an ingredient and then clicks the button or hits [Enter], the API call is made and the database retrieves meal names and thumbnail photos in a stylized table, or it displays a message to the user saying no meals could be found with the ingredient they entered.</p>
           <br>
           <h2>Application Ideas</h2>
        <p>1. Social Media, Messanger, or Email: <br>
            GIFs can be used in communicating context. Users can easily express themselves and animate their emotions and conversations with GIFs
            when they communicate with others. It would be great if a keyword is automatically extracted from text a user has written and an application recommends proper GIFs for it.
        </p>
        <p>2. New Tab Extension for Chrome: <br>
            When a user opens a new tab, random or trending GIFs are displayed. It will transform a boring “new tab” page into a fun one. 
            It might be better than a search-box-filled screen. We can also use data from other APIs such as weather or
            news media for a parameter (search query). Users then can be provided context-related GIFs.

        <h2>About TheMealDB API</h2>
        <p>TheMealDB is an open online database of recipes for meals. It was written by somebody who felt that there was no suitable API for his needs, so he wrote one himself. It is very rudimentary, but it provides the names of meals that someone might want to cook, high quality PNG images of ingredients, and also high quality PNG images of fully-cooked meals. Some things you can do with it are:
        <ul>
            <li>Search a meal by name</li>
            <li>Lookup full meal details by id</li>
            <li>Looup a random meal</li>
            <li>Get latest meals (to keep things spicy!)</li>
            <li>List all categories, area, and ingredients</li>
            <li>Filter by ingredient</li>
            <li>Filter by category</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Options for the API Request</h2>
        <p>Word is used as a parameter to the API call. I set "tada" as a default word as you can see when page is loaded. 
           When user enters a word or phrase in the input field and hit the Generate button, the GIPHY search engine finds GIFs with the word as a search query.</p>
           <br>
           <h2>Application Ideas</h2>
        <p>1. Social Media, Messanger, or Email: <br>
            GIFs can be used in communicating context. Users can easily express themselves and animate their emotions and conversations with GIFs
            when they communicate with others. It would be great if a keyword is automatically extracted from text a user has written and an application recommends proper GIFs for it.
        </p>
        <p>2. New Tab Extension for Chrome: <br>
            When a user opens a new tab, random or trending GIFs are displayed. It will transform a boring “new tab” page into a fun one. 
            It might be better than a search-box-filled screen. We can also use data from other APIs such as weather or
            news media for a parameter (search query). Users then can be provided context-related GIFs.

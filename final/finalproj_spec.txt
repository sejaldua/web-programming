Your assignment is to create a web app.

The topic is up to you!  It has to have an intuitive interface but I am not requiring a stellar design since this is a web programming course.

I am expecting for you to challenge yourselves by getting something complex working rather than creating a multi-page site.  This is your opportunity to take what you have learned (including how to figure out new web technologies) and create something cool.

Requirements:

Must use HTML/CSS/Javascript and/or jQuery
Must use a database
Must use a server side program - you my use PHP or  node.js / Heroku to accomplish this
Must use an external API
There is NO requirement for:

# of pages
# of forms
# of lines of code
Ideas:

This is an amazing compendium of ideas.  Also about halfway down the page is a list of public API's

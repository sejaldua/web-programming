Objective: Practice with XML and CSS

Task:

Your assignment is to create an XML document to represent a set list for a cover band.  Each entry should have space to describe the artist(s), title, music genre, and year the song was released.

Your file must include at least 10 songs.  The data must be real, but you can use any artist/band.

Create a CSS file for aesthetic display of the data.

Note:  You are NOT required to produce DTD, schema, or XSL files, but you may give it a shot if you want to explore this technology. (Extra credit may be awarded if your work is exemplary).

Deliverables: 

PDF file containing the XML and CSS code
URL of the XML document online
